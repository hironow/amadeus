# What / Why / How Conformance

This is the single source of truth for amadeus's purpose, design rationale, and implementation approach.
Referenced from [README.md](../README.md) and [docs/README.md](README.md).

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **What** | Post-merge integrity verification system that measures codebase divergence from intended design |
| **Why** | Detect architectural drift early and route corrective actions before design debt compounds |
| **How** | Scan merged PRs → Claude evaluates against ADRs/DoDs → score 4 divergence axes → route D-Mails by severity → enter D-Mail waiting loop (fsnotify inbox/ watch, re-check on arrival); with `--base`: additionally run PR convergence pipeline via `gh` CLI |
| **Input** | Git log (merged PRs), ADRs, DoDs, codebase source, inbox D-Mails; with `--base`: open PR state (via `gh` CLI) |
| **Output** | Divergence scores, corrective D-Mails (design-feedback / implementation-feedback from divergence scoring, works with or without `--base`) to downstream tools, insight ledger files (`insights/divergence.md` with LLM-enriched How, `insights/convergence.md` with archive-enriched Why); with `--base`: additionally PR convergence reports |
| **Telemetry** | OTel spans: `amadeus.run`, `reading_steiner`, `divergence_meter`, `claude.invoke` (with `claude.model`, `claude.timeout_sec`, `gen_ai.*`); `context_budget.*` attributes: `context_budget.tools`, `context_budget.skills`, `context_budget.plugins`, `context_budget.mcp_servers`, `context_budget.hook_bytes`, `context_budget.estimated_tokens` |
| **External Systems** | Claude Code subprocess, Git, `gh` CLI (PR reading), OTel exporter (Jaeger/Weave), fsnotify (inbox watcher) |

## Layer Architecture

```
cmd              --> usecase, session, usecase/port, platform, harness, domain  (composition root)
usecase          --> usecase/port, harness, domain                              (output port only)
usecase/port     --> domain (+ stdlib)                                          (interface contracts)
session          --> eventsource, usecase/port, platform, harness, domain       (adapter impl)
harness          --> domain                                                     (LLM mediation facade)
  harness/policy   --> domain                                                   (deterministic decisions, no LLM)
  harness/verifier --> domain, harness/policy                                   (validation rules, no LLM)
  harness/filter   --> domain, harness/verifier, harness/policy                 (LLM action spaces: prompts, response schemas)
eventsource      --> domain                                                     (event persistence adapter)
platform         --> domain (+ stdlib)                                          (cross-cutting infra)
domain           --> (nothing internal, stdlib only)                             (pure types/logic)
```

`harness` mediates between the LLM and the task environment. It is the single import surface for all decision, validation, and specification logic. The facade (`harness.go`) re-exports symbols from three sub-packages ordered by LLM-dependence:

- **`harness/policy`** — Deterministic decisions with no LLM involvement (merge readiness, PR convergence reports, merge method selection)
- **`harness/verifier`** — Validation rules with no LLM involvement (D-Mail schema validation, provider error classification)
- **`harness/filter`** — LLM action spaces: externalized YAML prompts via `PromptRegistry`, response schemas, and GEPA prompt optimization scaffold

Callers import `harness` (the facade), not the sub-packages directly. Semgrep rules in `.semgrep/layers-harness.yaml` enforce the internal dependency order.

`eventsource` is the event persistence adapter based on the [AWS Event Sourcing pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-design-patterns/event-sourcing.html).
Its responsibility is limited to append, load, and replay of domain events.
Event store implementation MUST NOT exist outside `internal/eventsource`.
`session` uses `eventsource` as a client but does not implement event persistence itself.

Key constraints enforced by semgrep (ERROR severity):

- `usecase --> session` PROHIBITED (must use output port interfaces)
- `cmd --> eventsource` PROHIBITED (ADR S0008)
- `domain --> harness` PROHIBITED (domain is pure types/logic)
- `eventsource --> harness` PROHIBITED
- `harness/policy` must not import `harness/verifier` or `harness/filter` (most independent layer)
- `domain` has no I/O, no `context.Context`

## Domain Primitives & Parse-Don't-Validate

Domain command types use the Parse-Don't-Validate pattern:

- Domain primitives (`RepoPath`, `Days`) validate in `New*()` constructors — invalid values are rejected at parse time
- Command types use unexported fields with `New*Command()` constructors that accept only pre-validated primitives
- Commands are always-valid by construction — no `Validate() []error` methods exist
- Usecase layer receives always-valid commands with no validation boilerplate
- Semgrep rule `domain-no-validate-method` prevents reintroduction of `Validate() []error`

## Tracking Mode (Wave vs Linear)

### Claude Subprocess Isolation

Claude subprocess uses layered isolation to prevent parent session context (266+ skills, 66+ plugins) from inflating token usage:

- `--setting-sources ""` skips all user/project settings (hooks, plugins, auto-memory) while preserving OAuth authentication
- `--settings <stateDir>/.claude/settings.json` loads tool-specific settings (empty `enabledPlugins`)
- `--disable-slash-commands` prevents user skills from inflating context
- `--strict-mcp-config --mcp-config <stateDir>/.mcp.json` enforces MCP server allowlist
- `mcp-config generate` creates both `.mcp.json` (wave: empty, linear: Linear MCP) and `.claude/settings.json`
- User can edit `.mcp.json` to add custom MCP servers, `.claude/settings.json` for env vars or permissions

### Claude Log Persistence

- `WriteClaudeLog` saves raw NDJSON to `.run/claude-logs/{timestamp}.jsonl` after each invocation
- Enables post-hoc debugging and audit of Claude subprocess interactions
- Managed by archive-prune lifecycle

- **Wave mode** (default, `--linear` not set): `checkLinearMCP` in doctor is skipped (status: SKIP, "wave mode"). D-Mail wave field is accepted but not yet used for divergence scoring.
- **Linear mode** (`--linear`): Existing behavior — `checkLinearMCP` validates Linear MCP connection.
- `runDoctor` receives `TrackingMode` parameter to conditionally run mode-specific checks.

## Harness Inventory (Track A)

amadeus harness sub-packages and their current function count:

| Sub-package | Functions | Role |
|-------------|-----------|------|
| `harness/policy` | `DetermineCorrectionDecision`, `CorrectiveTargetAgentForFailure`, `DetectOwnerLoop`, `providerStateGate`, `EvaluateExhaustion`, `RunGuard` | Deterministic decisions (routing, exhaustion, run locking) |
| `harness/verifier` | Provider error classification, D-Mail schema validation | Validation rules |
| `harness/filter` | `PromptRegistry`, response schemas, GEPA scaffold | LLM action spaces |

Ref: ADR S0038, S0039, `refs/opsx/semgrep-layer-contract.md`

## Improvement Controller (Track D3/F)

The improvement controller (Weave feedback collector, normalized signal store, corrective policy generation) resides in amadeus session layer. This is an intentional placement decision (ADR S0041).

Key components:
- `session/improvement_collector.go` — Weave feedback polling + normalization
- `session/improvement_signal_store.go` — SQLite sink + outcome transition + aggregation
- `session/improvement_weave_source.go` — HTTP adapter for Weave API

## Cross-Tool Conformance

All 4 tools (phonewave, sightjack, paintress, amadeus) maintain a What/Why/How conformance table in `docs/conformance.md` with the same structure. This prevents expression drift across README files.
